# SFML-PlatformerGame
Little SFML c++ game I made over a couple of with my sfml game framework

[CONTROLS]
A -> move left
D -> move right
S -> fall downward
SPACE -> jump
Q -> pause
E -> unpause
R -> restart

[How it works]
You can only jump when the jump button is green.
You can regain it by waiting for a jump cooldown and touch either the sides or top of a platform
Goal: survive as long as possible
You can see your score in the top left along with your highscore and your jump state.
